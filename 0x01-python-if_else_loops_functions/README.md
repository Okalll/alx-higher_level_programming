Lists.h is the header file for question 13

Task 0
-Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative

Task 1

-Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number

Task 2

-Write a program that prints thr ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line

Task 3

-Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line except 'q' and 'e'

Task 4

-Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal using only print function

Task 5

-Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 98, numbers should be separated by ',' followedd by a space and last number followed by a new line

Task 6

-Write a program that prints all possible different combinatins of two digits

Task 7

-Write a function that checks for lowercase characters using the prototype: def islower(c)

Task 8

-Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line using the prototype: def uppercase(str)

Task 9

-Write a function that prints the last digit of a number using the prototype: def print_last_digit(number)

Task 10

-Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result using the prototype: def add (a, b)

Task 11

-Write a function that computes 'a' to the power of 'b' and return the value using the prototype: def pow(a, b)

Task 12

-Write a function tha prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space using the prototype: def fizzbuzz()

Task 13

-Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

Prototype: listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);
Return: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed

Task 14

-Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.

Task 15

-Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
